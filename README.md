# car-sensor-pic16f877A
it's a car sensor using microcontroller PIC16f877A and ultrasonic sensors and an LCD and BUZZER and LEDS
This code connects and configures an LCD module and four ultrasonic sensors with a microcontroller. The LCD module uses specific pins on PORTB: RB4 for Register Select (LCD_RS), RB5 for Enable (LCD_EN), and RB0 to RB3 for data lines D4 to D7. Corresponding direction bits (LCD_RS_Direction, LCD_EN_Direction, LCD_D4_Direction, etc.) are set to configure these pins as outputs. The ultrasonic sensors are connected to PORTD, with Trig1, Trig2, Trig3, and Trig4 on pins 0, 2, 4, and 6 respectively, used to send trigger pulses, and Echo1, Echo2, Echo3, and Echo4 on pins 1, 3, 5, and 7 respectively, used to receive echo pulses. In the initialization function, TRISD is set to configure the direction of PORTD pins, making Trig pins outputs and Echo pins inputs. ADCON1 is configured to set all AN pins as digital inputs, and the LCD is initialized with commands to clear the display and turn off the cursor. TRISC is configured to set all PORTC pins as outputs. The distance measurement function, Measure_Distance, operates by sending a 10-microsecond trigger pulse on the specified trigPin and then waiting for an echo pulse on the echoPin. It uses Timer1 to measure the duration of the echo pulse, calculates the time of flight, and converts this to a distance in centimeters using a factor of 58. In the main loop, distances from the four ultrasonic sensors are continuously measured. If any distance is less than or equal to 50 cm, all bits in PORTC are set, turning on all connected devices; otherwise, all bits in PORTC are cleared. Measured distances are divided by 2 for display purposes, converted to strings, and shown on the LCD, with updates occurring every second.
